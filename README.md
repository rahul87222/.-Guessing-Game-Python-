# .-Guessing-Game-Python-
 I built a fun number guessing game in Python. The computer selects a random number, and the user has to guess it. After each guess, the program gives hints whether the guess is too high or too low, and counts the number of attempts. This project enhanced my logic-building and user interaction skills.
